Growing up on the moon, Xingyin is accustomed to solitude, unaware that she is being hidden from the feared Celestial Emperor who exiled her mother for stealing his elixir of immortality. But when Xingyin’s magic flares and her existence is discovered, she is forced to flee her home, leaving her mother behind. Alone, powerless, and afraid, she makes her way to the Celestial Kingdom, a land of wonder and secrets. Disguising her identity, she seizes an opportunity to learn alongside the emperor’s son, mastering archery and magic, even as passion flames between her and the prince. To save her mother, Xingyin embarks on a perilous quest, confronting legendary creatures and vicious enemies. But when treachery looms and forbidden magic threatens the kingdom, she must challenge the ruthless Celestial Emperor for her dream—striking a dangerous bargain in which she is torn between losing all she loves or plunging the realm into chaos. Daughter of the Moon Goddess begins an enchanting duology which weaves ancient Chinese mythology into a sweeping adventure of immortals and magic, of loss and sacrifice—where love vies with honor, dreams are fraught with betrayal, and hope emerges triumphant.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780063031326"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0063031329"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":426,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.6.5.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-eEoEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-eEoEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-eEoEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=daughter+of+the+moon+goddess&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-eEoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-eEoEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":7.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":7.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-eEoEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book--eEoEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":7990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":7990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Daughter_of_the_Moon_Goddess-sample-epub.acsm?id=-eEoEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-eEoEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The

To give fifteen-year-old Nita a vacation from magic—and her partner Kit—her parents pack her off for a stay with her eccentric aunt in Ireland. But Nita soon finds herself with a host of Irish wizards battling mythical beings, wolves, and elves from a nightmare land. In Wizard Abroad, “Duane seamlessly interweaves encounters with creatures from legend with glimpses of modern Irish life and teen culture. Her view of magic’s place in the scheme of things is so clever and well reasoned that readers will have no trouble suspending belief (School Library Journal). “Exceptional.”—Science Fiction Chronicle “The series may be of particular interest to female readers as Nita and her younger sister are the focus of most of the books and they are strong female characters. If you’ve read the other Wizardry books, this fourth book in the series won’t disappoint you.”—SF Site Praise for the Young Wizards series “Duane is tops in the high adventure business . . . This rollicking yarn will delight readers.”—Publishers Weekly “High Wizardry is . . . high entertainment.”—Locus “Recommend this series to young teens who devour books about magic and wizards . . . or kids looking for ‘Harry Potter’ read-alikes.”—School Library Journal “Stands between the works of Diana Wynne Jones . . . and Madeleine L’Engle . . . An outstanding, original work.”—The Horn Book","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780547546797"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0547546793"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":249,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Juvenile Fiction"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.5.4.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z7DqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z7DqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z7DqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=diane+duane&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z7DqDwAAQBAJ&dq=diane+duane&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Wizard_Abroad.html?hl=&id=Z7DqDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/A_Wizard_Abroad-sample-epub.acsm?id=Z7DqDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/A_Wizard_Abroad-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Z7DqDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Z7DqDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This rollicking yarn will delight readers.&quot;— Publishers Weekly &quot; High Wizardry is . . . high entertainment.&quot;— Locus &quot;Recommend this series to young teens who devour books about magic and wizards . . . or kids looking for &#39;Harry Potter&#39; ..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"VTu8i9vGUksC","etag":"BbrJgVvavqk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VTu8i9vGUksC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Cat in the Hat","authors":["Dr. Seuss"],"publisher":"Random House Books for Young Readers","publishedDate":"2012","description":"The Cat in the Hat entertains two children on a rainy day.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780449810866"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0449810860"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":73,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Juvenile Fiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":13,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.3.0.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VTu8i9vGUksC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VTu8i9vGUksC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VTu8i9vGUksC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+cat+in+the+hat&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VTu8i9vGUksC&dq=the+cat+in+the+hat&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Cat_in_the_Hat.html?hl=&id=VTu8i9vGUksC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=VTu8i9vGUksC&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The Cat in the Hat entertains two children on a rainy day."}}]
