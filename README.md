# My Bookshelf

## About

My Bookshelf is a responsive web application that allows users to search for books and manage a personal **To-Be-Read** list.

This project was created as my **Code:You Capstone Project** and demonstrates concepts learned throughout the course. Even though this project is intended as a learning exercise I hope to further add to it in the future.

Users can:
- Search for books using the Google Books API
- Add books to a personal TBR list
- Remove books from the list
